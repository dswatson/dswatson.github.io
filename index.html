        I am a doctoral candidate at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, where my research focuses on the conceptual and technical foundations of explainable machine learning. I am also the CTO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.thermoai.com/">ThermoAI</a>, a clean energy startup devoted to reducing global emissions through smarter combustion modeling and optimization. I am a founding member of Oxford’s <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/digital-ethics-lab/">Digital Ethics Lab</a>, an occasional contributor to <a href="https://www.economist.com//">The Economist</a>, and a Data Scientist at large for Queen Mary University’s <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/c4tb/">Centre for Translational Bioinformatics</a>.
        </br>
        </br>
        TL;DR – I am passionate about developing rigorous, interpretable methods for analyzing complex systems in the natural and social sciences.

        When I’m not doing research, I like to play <a href="https://soundcloud.com/david-watson">music</a> and get real worked up about my favorite (and least favorite) works of theatre, film, and fiction.

            My research is broadly focused on developing flexible Bayesian methods. My work has focused on developing appropriate Bayesian methods for complex longitudinal data, as well as developing model selection and variable selection tools within the Bayesian nonparametric framework for high dimensional problems. I am also pursuing research in Bayesian nonparametrics for missing data and causal inference problems in which analysts are forced to (i) confront the curse of dimensionality when estimating low-dimensional effects of interest and (ii) are required to make in-principle unverifiable assumptions. Developing flexible Bayesian nonparametric models which give robust inferences in these scenarios is fraught with subtle challenges.
