        I am a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College London</a>'s <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics">Department of Informatics</a>. My primary research interests include machine learning, philosophy of science, and computational biology.
        <br />
        <br />
        Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/">Department of Statistical Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>, where I developed methods for causal discovery and inference. Before that, I earned my doctorate from the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, studying algorithmic fairness and explainability. I am an Associate Editor at <em><a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/13347/editors">Philosophy & Technology</a></em>, an occasional contributor to <em><a href="https://www.economist.com//">The Economist</a></em>, and a Data Scientist at large for Queen Mary University’s <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/c4tb/">Centre for Translational Bioinformatics</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        TL;DR – I am passionate about developing rigorous, interpretable methods for analyzing complex systems in the natural and social sciences.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also have the privilege of supervising some awesome doctoral candidates:

        When I’m not doing research, I like to play <a href="https://soundcloud.com/david-watson">music</a> and get real worked up about my favorite (and least favorite) books, plays, and movies.  
        <br />
