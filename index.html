      I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/">Department of Statistical Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>, where I develop machine learning methods for causal inference. Before that, I earned my doctorate from the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, studying explainable artificial intelligence at the <a href="http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Internet Institute</a>. In addition to my academic work, I am also the CTO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.thermoai.com/">ThermoAI</a>, a clean energy startup devoted to reducing global emissions through smarter combustion modeling and optimization. I am a founding member of Oxford’s <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/digital-ethics-lab/">Digital Ethics Lab</a>, an occasional contributor to <a href="https://www.economist.com//">The Economist</a>, and a Data Scientist at large for Queen Mary University’s <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/c4tb/">Centre for Translational Bioinformatics</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        TL;DR – I am passionate about developing rigorous, interpretable methods for analyzing complex systems in the natural and social sciences.

        <br />
        When I’m not doing research, I like to play <a href="https://soundcloud.com/david-watson">music</a> and get real worked up about my favorite (and least favorite) works of theatre, film, and fiction.
